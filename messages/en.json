If you're building something solo or with a small team, and you want a simple, fast way to manage tasks without all the bloat, TheGroupFinder is for you."
        },
        "whatIsIt": {
          "question": "What is TheGroupFinder?",
          "answer": "TheGroupFinder is a simple, AI-powered task management tool. You can create tasks, organize projects, and manage your work through natural language. No need to learn complex interfaces - just tell the AI what you need and it handles the rest."
        },
        "howAIWorks": {
          "question": "How does the AI assistant work?",
          "answer": "Just chat with it naturally. Say things like 'Create a task for fixing the login bug' or 'Show me all high-priority tasks' and the AI does it. No clicking through menus or filling out forms - just talk to it like a teammate."

        "isFree": {
          "question": "Is TheGroupFinder free?",
          "answer": "Yes! TheGroupFinder is completely free and open source. All features including AI-powered task management are available at no cost. You can also self-host it on your own server."
        },
        "needTeam": {
          "question": "Do I need a team to use it?",

        },
        "howToStart": {
          "question": "How do I get started?",
          "answer": "Sign up with Google or Email (we'll send you a verification code), create a workspace, and start chatting with the AI. That's it. The AI will help you create your first project and tasks. No tutorial needed."

        "dataSafety": {
          "question": "Is my data safe?",
          "answer": "Yes. TheGroupFinder uses secure authentication and you can self-host it to keep your data on your own server. The code is open source, so you can verify everything yourself."
