          "question": "How does the AI assistant work?",
          "answer": "Just chat with it naturally. Say things like 'Create a task for fixing the login bug' or 'Show me all high-priority tasks' and the AI does it. No clicking through menus or filling out forms - just talk to it like a teammate."
