### Database Schema

The application uses PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM. The main entities are:

- **Team** - Top-level workspace organization
- **Project** - Project containers within teams
- **ProjectMember** - User-project relationships for project-specific team assignments
- **Issue** - Task items with priority, status, and estimates
- **WorkflowState** - Custom workflow states (backlog, todo, in progress, etc.)
- **Label** - Categorization tags for issues
- **TeamMember** - User-team relationships with roles
- **Invitation** - Pending team invitations via email
- **ChatConversation** - AI chatbot conversation history
- **ChatMessage** - Individual messages in conversations

### API Routes

- `/api/auth/*` - Better Auth authentication handlers
- `/api/teams/*` - Team management and CRUD operations
- `/api/teams/[teamId]/issues/*` - Issue management
- `/api/teams/[teamId]/projects/*` - Project management

- `/api/invitations/[invitationId]` - Public invitation details

### AI Chatbot

The chatbot is powered by Vercel AI SDK with Groq using the GPT-OSS (Open Source GPT) 120B model. It uses function calling for:

- **Creating and updating issues** - Natural language task creation with automatic field resolution
- **Managing projects** - Create, update, and manage project containers
- **Managing project members** - Add or remove team members from projects via natural language
- **Inviting team members** - Send team invitations via email
- **Retrieving team statistics** - Get overview of team activity and metrics
- **Listing and filtering issues** - Query and display tasks with various filters
- **Getting issue details** - Retrieve complete information about specific tasks

**Key Features:**

- Natural language understanding for project management commands
- Automatic resolution of names to IDs (workflow states, assignees, projects, labels)
- Multi-step tool execution capability
- Conversation history persistence in database
- Streaming responses for real-time interaction
- Team-specific API key support (BYOK - Bring Your Own Key)

Chat history is persisted in the database for each conversation, allowing users to resume previous discussions.

### AI Features Setup

1. **Get a Groq API Key:**
   - Visit [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com/)
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Generate a new API key from the API Keys section
   - Copy the key (starts with `gsk_`)

2. **Configure API Key:**
   - Add `GROQ_API_KEY` to your `.env.local` file (applies to all users globally)

3. **Start Using AI:**
   - Navigate to any team's dashboard
   - Open the AI Chatbot interface
   - Start chatting with natural language commands like:
     - "Create a new issue for fixing the login bug"
     - "Show me all high-priority issues"
     - "Update the checkout page issue to In Progress and assign it to John"
     - "Add Sarah to the Web Project"
     - "List members of the API project"

### Google OAuth Setup

1. Go to Google Cloud Console
2. Create a new project or select existing
3. Navigate to APIs & Services > Credentials
4. Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID
5. Add authorized redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
6. Copy Client ID and Client Secret to your .env.local file

### Cloudinary Setup (For Video Optimization)

Cloudinary is used to serve optimized videos on the landing page. If not configured, videos will fall back to local files from the `/public` directory.

1. **Create a Cloudinary Account:**
   - Visit [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com/)
   - Sign up for a free account (includes 25GB storage and 25GB bandwidth)

2. **Get Your Credentials:**
   - Go to your [Cloudinary Dashboard](https://console.cloudinary.com/)
   - Copy your Cloud Name, API Key, and API Secret from the Dashboard

3. **Add to .env.local:**
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your-cloud-name"
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your-api-secret"
   ```

   **Note:** The `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix is required for client-side access. The API key and secret are server-only and won't be exposed to the client.

4. **Upload Your Videos:**

   You have two options:

   **Option A: Automated Upload (Recommended)**
   - Run the upload script:
     ```bash
     npm run upload:videos
     ```
   - This will automatically upload all videos from `/public` to Cloudinary
   - Videos will be uploaded with the correct public IDs:
     - `doable` (for the main demo video)
     - `feature-1-doable`
     - `feature-2-doable`
     - `feature-3-doable`
     - `feature-4-doable`
     - `feature-5-doable`

   **Option B: Manual Upload via Dashboard**
   - Go to your [Cloudinary Media Library](https://console.cloudinary.com/console/media_library)
   - Upload your videos manually
   - Make sure the public IDs match the names above (without the `.mp4` extension)

5. **Benefits:**
   - Automatic video format optimization (WebM for supported browsers)
   - Quality optimization based on connection speed
   - CDN delivery for faster loading
   - Automatic thumbnail generation for video posters
   - Reduced bandwidth costs

**If Cloudinary is not configured:** The app will automatically fall back to serving videos from the `/public` directory.
