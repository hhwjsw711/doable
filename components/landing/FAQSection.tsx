    question: "Who is TheGroupFinder for?",
    answer: "TheGroupFinder is built for individuals and indie hackers who want to get things done instead of wasting time on complicated tools. If you're building something solo or with a small team, and you want a simple, fast way to manage tasks without all the bloat, TheGroupFinder is for you."
  },
  {
    question: "What is TheGroupFinder?",
    answer: "TheGroupFinder is a simple, AI-powered task management tool. You can create tasks, organize projects, and manage your work through natural language. No need to learn complex interfaces - just tell the AI what you need and it handles the rest."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the AI assistant work?",
    answer: "Just chat with it naturally. Say things like 'Create a task for fixing the login bug' or 'Show me all high-priority tasks' and the AI does it. No clicking through menus or filling out forms - just talk to it like a teammate."
  },
  {
    question: "Is TheGroupFinder free?",
    answer: "Yes! TheGroupFinder is completely free and open source. You'll need a Groq API key for the AI features (which has a generous free tier), but everything else is unlimited. You can also self-host it on your own server."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use my own API key?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Bring your own Groq API key and use it. You can set it globally or per-team, giving you full control over costs and usage."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a team to use it?",
    answer: "Nope. While TheGroupFinder supports teams, it works great for solo projects too. Create your workspace, add projects, and start managing tasks. Invite others later if you want."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I get started?",
    answer: "Sign up with Google, create a workspace, and start chatting with the AI. That's it. The AI will help you create your first project and tasks. No tutorial needed."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data safe?",
    answer: "Yes. TheGroupFinder uses secure authentication and you can self-host it to keep your data on your own server. The code is open source, so you can verify everything yourself."
